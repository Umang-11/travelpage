               is to visit famous landmarks or simply learn about new people

                finding the best trips?

                <h3>BEACHES</h3>
                <p>Living on a tropical island with palm-fringed trees is everyone’s
                     dream, isn’t it? However, I love the beach because of how it makes
                      me feel, rather than the aesthetic factor (though it adds to that
                       wonderful feeling). I have no idea why do people like the beach,
                        I am sure everyone has their own reasons </p>

                <h3>FORESTS</h3>
                <p>Forests cover a significant area of the earth. They are a great natural asset to any region and hold immense value. For instance, forests fulfill all our needs of timber, fuel, fodder, bamboos and more. They also give us a variety of products that hold great commercial as well as industrial value.</p>
